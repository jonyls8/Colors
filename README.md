# Colors

With the colors you can express emotions, emotions that make us adapt to the enviroment we live, with this project I wanted to make something useful for myself, saving

the color palettes that I love to use it for future projects.



Project about colors (colors palette). I start using ES6 elements such as arrow functions. I use a library called Chroma.Js which It was so useful to make the process faster and build saturation, brightness and the own color.

You can save the palettes in the localStorage to use it in the future, delete palettes or even modify the existing one
